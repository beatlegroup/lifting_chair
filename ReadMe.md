Background/ Client Info:

 * Our client is Micah Holmes at the Longmont Fire Department. The fire fighters are struggling with assisting obese individuals that have fallen and cannot get up by themselves. Due to the heavy weight the Firefighters are acquiring long term injuries. Those who have fallen also tend to fall in odd locations that add onto the already difficult task.

Design Requirements:

 * Lightweight
 * Fit in small spaces
 * Lift up to 400 pounds
 * Easy set up/ fast set up
 * Easily fit in a Firetruck
 * Portable

Design Alternatives:

 * We had at first debated using a hammock like solution but vetoed that idea due to difficulty in finding a was to shift the system under the person. Another alternative was to slip a backboard under the individuals torso and then use a scissor jack so that they are sitting upright. But from there there would still be much difficulty sit standing up the person. Our final design differs from the prototype because it has handles. We had originally planned on having scissor jacks on the four corners of the bottom of the chair to lift it up.

Overview of Process:

 * We have decided to make the skeleton of the chair two separate pieces. By having the chair be made up of two separate side pieces, the frames can be easily slid underneath the obese body. We deducted that it would be easiest having two pieces because it would be difficult to lift the entire body to slide a structure underneath. The skeleton has four bars, each is attached to another with a hinge to make a joint. The joint allows us to move the top bars up to resemble a chair. Bars are sticking out of the bars perpendicular to the floor when the structure is lying down. These bars each support a portion of the bodyweight on the sides of the body. With enough bars all of the weight should be supported. Because there are two pieces we need to attach them. Adjustable bars are attached to the tops of the bars. They need to be adjustable to fit the varying widths of individuals being assisted.

Prototype:

 * The prototype is made out of oak wood, hinges, eye hooks, steel rods,
and string. We tested the prototype by tying a total of twenty-five
pounds in sand bags onto the chair. By pulling the strings which are
tied onto the eye hooks the top of the chair moved up, bending the
hinges. The prototype took a total of three days to assemble.

Progress:

 * Week of 10/20: Worked through the brainstorming process
 * Week of 10/27:Presented idea for the project
 * Week of 11/3: Finished the prototype
 * Week of 11/10: Created the critical piece
 * Week of 11/17: Finished the final product

Final Product:

 * The frame is made out of four steel bars. Foot long pieces of rebar have been welded into the frame to support the body. Two pairs of the bars have been attached together with hinges that are bolted into the metal. Ends of the bar are cut of and welded onto the top side with holes drilled in so that it can be linked onto adjustable bars. These bars allow us to choose the width of the frame so that it fits to the width of the individual being assisted. A crank has been attached onto the ends of the bars by the individuals feet. String is attached to the bars at the very end of the system near the individuals head. A wrench is used to crank up the body’s torso into a sitting position. Steel handles are welded onto the four corners of the bottom bars, allowing the firefighters to lift the individual and move them to a more convenient location.

Calculations:

 * W=P/L
 * I=(¼)pi( r)^4
 * I=pi(¼)(¼)^4
 * I=.00308
 * P=weight(pound)=300
 * I= moment of inertia
 * L= length of bar(in) =6in
 * E=modulus of elasticity(pounds/in^2)=2.9E7

 * To find how far the bar will bend: -SPL^3/48EI=-.0062298

Testing:

 * We first started by using the chair for smaller weights. First we tested the system with 115 pounds,then 170 pounds, and finally 240 pounds. We have not yet tested the chair with the average weight of an obese individual but plan on doing so by using sand bags or some form of weight. We did not try living the chair with the 240 pound individual due to the team members not having the strength of the average fire fighter to do so.
