Prototype:
The prototype is made out of oak wood, hinges, eye hooks, steel rods,
and string. We tested the prototype by tying a total of twenty-five
pounds in sand bags onto the chair. By pulling the strings which are
tied onto the eye hooks the top of the chair moved up, bending the
hinges. The prototype took a total of three days to assemble.

The Budget:
Prototype $34.72
2 Cranks $52.54
Square Tubes $64.84
Hitch Pin $23.88
Poles with Holes $70.06 we might return two of the poles
Rebar $15.84
Hinges $22.43
Rope $10.50
Bolts and Nuts $.98
Padding $10.82
Handles $9.06
Total $315.67

Money Each Team Member has Spent:
Mackenzie $149.51
McCartney $132.45
Cameron $34.72


Calculations:
- W=P/L
- I=(¼)pi( r)^4
- I=pi(¼)(¼)^4
- I=.00308
- P=weight(pound)=300
- I= moment of inertia
- L= length of bar(in) =6in
- E=modulus of elasticity(pounds/in^2)=2.9E7

- To find how far the bar will bend: -SPL^3/48EI=-.0062298

Testing:
We first started by using the chair for smaller weights. First we tested the system with 115 pounds,then 170 pounds, and finally 240 pounds. We have not yet tested the chair with the average weight of an obese individual but plan on doing so by using sand bags or some form of weight. We did not try living the chair with the 240 pound individual due to the team members not having the strength of the average fire fighter to do so.
